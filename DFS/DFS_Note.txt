It is a recursive algorithms.
*** Search all the vertices of a Tree or a Graph

***Implementation 
1) Topological Sorting
2)Find the paths between and two vertices
3)Detect Cycles
4)Graphs is Bipartite or not ??

***pseudo code

DFS(Graph , Vertices)
          Stack S = {}
          for each vertex u , set visited[u] = 0
          push S,Vertices;
          While (S is not empty)
              Do
              u := pop S
          If( ! visited[u])
          Then
          visited[u] := 1
          for each unvisited neighbour w of u
            push S,w;
      end if
   end while
end DFS()
