BFS algorithm is a graph transversal algorithm.
Breadth First Traversal or Breadth First Search is a recursive algorithm for searching all the vertices of a graph or tree data structure.
It makes use of a queue data structure with FIFO (first in, first out) ordering. 

Applications:
To build index by search index.

For GPS navigation.

Path finding algorithms.

In Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to find maximum flow in a network.

Cycle detection in an undirected graph.

In minimum spanning tree.

The time complexity of the BFS algorithm is  O(V + E), where V is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges.

The space complexity of the algorithm is O(V).
