BFS algorithm is a graph transversal algorithm.
Breadth First Traversal or Breadth First Search is a recursive algorithm for searching all the vertices of a graph or tree data structure.
It makes use of a queue data structure with FIFO (first in, first out) ordering. 

Applications:
To build index by search index.

For GPS navigation.

Path finding algorithms.

In Ford-Fulkerson algorithm to find maximum flow in a network.

Cycle detection in an undirected graph.

In minimum spanning tree.
